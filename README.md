Guess the Number Game

Description

The "Guess the Number Game" is a simple and fun web game where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. It's a great way to test your luck and challenge your intuition. This project aims to provide a playful experience, where users receive feedback if their guess is too high or too low until they find the correct number. Once the number is guessed, the player can start a new game and continue the fun.
